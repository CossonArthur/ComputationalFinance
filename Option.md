# European

## Definition
A European option is a type of financial derivative that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before the expiration date.
- **Expiration Date:** European options can only be exercised at the expiration date, as opposed to American options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.
- **Settlement:** Settlement of European options occurs at the expiration date, where the option holder either exercises the option or allows it to expire worthless.
- **Advantages:** European options simplify decision-making for investors, as they eliminate the need for continuous monitoring and decision-making throughout the option's life.

# American 
## Definition
An American option is a type of financial derivative that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) at any time before or on the expiration date.
- **Exercise Flexibility:** Unlike European options, American options provide flexibility, allowing the holder to exercise the option at any point before or on the expiration date.
- **Expiration Date:** Similar to European options, American options have an expiration date, but the key distinction lies in the flexibility of exercising the option prior to this date.
- **Settlement:** Settlement for American options can occur at any time before or on the expiration date, giving the holder the advantage of choosing an optimal exercise time.
- **Advantages:** The flexibility in exercising American options provides enhanced opportunities for risk management and profit realization compared to European options.


# Asian 
## Definition
An Asian option is a type of financial derivative whose payoff is determined by the average price of the underlying asset over a specified period, rather than the spot price at a single point in time.
- **Averaging Period:** The key feature of Asian options is the averaging mechanism, where the payoff is influenced by the average price of the underlying asset over a predetermined period, such as the entire option's life or a specific interval.
- **Floating or Fixed Strike:** Asian options can have either a floating or fixed strike price. For a fixed strike Asian option, the average price is compared to the strike price. In a floating strike Asian option, the payoff is based on the difference between the average price and the spot price.
    
- **Reduced Volatility Impact:** The use of average prices tends to reduce the impact of short-term price fluctuations, making Asian options attractive for investors seeking to hedge against volatility.
    
- **Risk Management:** Asian options can be used for risk management purposes, particularly in markets where underlying asset prices are subject to substantial short-term fluctuations.
    
- **Unique Payoff Structure:** The unique payoff structure of Asian options distinguishes them from traditional European or American options, offering investors alternative strategies for managing exposure and market risk.
