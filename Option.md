# Asian 
## Definition
An Asian option is a type of financial derivative whose payoff is determined by the average price of the underlying asset over a specified period, rather than the spot price at a single point in time.
- **Averaging Period:** The key feature of Asian options is the averaging mechanism, where the payoff is influenced by the average price of the underlying asset over a predetermined period, such as the entire option's life or a specific interval.
- **Floating or Fixed Strike:** Asian options can have either a floating or fixed strike price. For a fixed strike Asian option, the average price is compared to the strike price. In a floating strike Asian option, the payoff is based on the difference between the average price and the spot price.
- **Advantages:** The use of average prices tends to reduce the impact of short-term price fluctuations, making Asian options attractive for investors seeking to hedge against volatility.
